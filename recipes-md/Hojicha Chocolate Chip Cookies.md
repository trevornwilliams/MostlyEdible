# Hojicha Chocolate Chip Cookies

## ingredients

- 12 tablespoons (170g) unsalted butter
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup (213g) packed brown sugar
- ½ cup (100g) granulated white sugar
- 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup (30g) rice flour
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt (or 1½ teaspoons coarse salt)
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons (20g) hojicha powder
- 1½ cups (200g) chocolate chips

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, rice flour, hojicha powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Using an electric hand mixer, beat for about a minute until fully combined and fluffy. Add the egg (or vegan substitute) and vanilla; beat again until just combined.
4. Add half of the flour mixture and mix on low until just combined. Add the remaining flour mixture and continue to mix on low until incorporated. Do not overmix.
5. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the chocolate chips. Mix by hand until they are evenly distributed.
6. Scoop the dough and roll into balls about the size of ping-pong balls. Place them on the parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 3 inches (7.5cm) apart.
7. Bake until the tops are cracked and lightly browned along the edges, about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack or plate to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough.

## notes

- Approximately 30 minutes for 15 servings
- Ensure your butter or vegan butter is very soft for easier mixing.
- Gently flatten the dough balls slightly if you prefer thinner cookies.
