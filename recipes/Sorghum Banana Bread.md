# Sorghum Banana Bread

## info

- About 55 minutes
- 8 servings

## ingredients

- ½ cup (113 g) butter, softened (Substitute oil for vegan)
- 1 egg (50 g) (Use an extra banana or applesauce for vegan)
- ⅓ cup (79 ml) sorghum
- 3 medium bananas, mashed (about 350 g)
- 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup (94 g) bread flour
- ½ teaspoon (2 g) baking soda
- ½ teaspoon (3 g) salt
- ½ teaspoon (1 g) ground nutmeg

### For Optional Topping

- ½ cup (60 g) chopped walnuts
- ¼ cup (50 g) brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon (8 g) cinnamon

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan or bundt pan with oil or butter.
3. In a large bowl, mix the wet ingredients first (bananas, butter/oil, egg, and sorghum), followed by the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg). Once combined, pour into the prepared pan.
4. For an optional extra-sweet topping, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and walnuts in a small bowl, then sprinkle over the batter.
5. Bake for 55 minutes in a loaf pan or 40 minutes in a bundt pan. Check doneness with a toothpick (or similar tool).

## notes

- If using a bundt pan, reduce baking time to around 40 minutes.
- A toothpick or thin skewer should come out clean when the bread is done.
