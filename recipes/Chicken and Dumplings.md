# Chicken and Dumplings

## info

- About 60 minutes
- 6 servings

## ingredients

- 6 chicken thighs or leg quarters
- 4 stalks of celery
- 4 carrots

### ROUX

- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour (about 32 g)
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil (about 60 mL)
- 8 1/2 cups chicken stock (2 liters)

### DOUGH

- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (about 220 g)
- 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal (about 32 g)
- 1 tablespoon baking powder (about 10 g)
- 3/4 cup water (about 180 mL)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (about 15 mL)

## steps

1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt. Place the chicken skin-side down and cook until browned, about 6 minutes. Flip and cook 2 more minutes, then transfer to a plate. Remove the crispy skin, slice it, and reserve for garnish.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the flour, cooking until the roux starts to darken, about 5 minutes.
3. Gradually pour in the chicken stock while whisking the roux. Lower the heat to a simmer (about 200°F/93°C).
4. In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, water, and vegetable oil for the dough. Stir just until combined, then turn out onto a floured surface.
5. Shape or scoop the dough into balls and drop them into the simmering broth. (If the broth is too hot, the dumplings may dissolve.) Cook for 10 minutes uncovered, then cover and cook an additional 10 minutes. Avoid stirring.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with the reserved crispy chicken skin.

## notes

- For best results, keep the heat at a gentle simmer to maintain the dumplings’ shape.
