# Vegan Breakfast Gravy

## info

- About 10 minutes
- 4 servings

## ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegan butter (~28 g)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (~16 g)
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (~8 g)
- 1½ cups unsweetened plant-based milk (soy, almond, or oat) (~360 ml)
- ½ teaspoon onion powder (~2.5 g)
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper (~2.5 g)
- ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste) (~2.5 g)

## steps

1. Make the roux: Melt the vegan butter in a skillet over medium heat. Gradually whisk in the flour until smooth and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly golden.
2. Add milk: Slowly pour in the plant-based milk while whisking to prevent lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, about 5–7 minutes.
3. Season: Stir in the nutritional yeast, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Adjust seasoning to taste.
4. Serve: Pour over biscuits, potatoes, or tofu scramble.

## notes

- Feel free to adjust the thickness by adding more milk if needed.
